The main difficultz is going to be regularitz of composed maps and dimensional reduction in  the deformed configuration.

The second focus of the proposal is related to the mathematical modeling of non- interpenetration of matter, and in particular on how this requirement can be rephrased to be amenable for numerical simulations. In [2], P.G. Ciarlet and J. Nečas proposed a condition compatible with the existence theory of minimizers in nonlinear elasticity, and ensuring frictionless contact and non-selfpenetrability. We stress that the Ciarlet-Nečas condition (C-N) together with det y > 0,  for y  the deformation, only guarantees injectivity almost everywhere, still allowing for situations with self-penetrations on sets of zero Lebesgue measure. Additionally, the numerical simulation of the C-N is problematic, as it requires  a-priori knowledge of the volume of the deformed configurations, which is often not available in applications. Our second goal is to advance a new treatment of impenetrability and injectivity constraints by proposing a new approximation of C-N with nonlocal terms.

However, there are several limitations when using PC for “in-vivo” quantification (e.g. low spatial resolution in respect to vessel diameter). Moreover, in case when stent was used for the treatment, the MR signal is strongly influence or even suppressed by the presence of metallic net of the stent wall creating RF shielded volume inside the stent. Therefore, the flow cannot be measured directly in the stent or very close to its border. But proper mathematical model of the flow character based on initial conditions provided by MRI outside the stent could help to predict the impact of the flow phenomena on the future vessel disease development.', 'mri, kvantifikace průtoku, matematické modelování toku, stenóza, stent, endovaskulární zákrok, mri, flow quantification, mathematical model of the flow, stenosis, stent, endovascular treatment');

Using quantum electro-dynamics principles, silicon-germanium quantum dots (QDs) in silicon will be optimised for high radiative efficiency at temperatures up to 300K. Ion implantation will be implemented during growth, modifying the electron wave function and improving the radiative recombination rate. Optimal and deterministic coupling of the QDs with high quality-factor resonators will be achieved by site controlled QD growth in combination with precisely aligned, lithographically defined photonic crystal resonators, allowing upscaling and a straight forward implementation of areas of identical single photon sources. Combining these sources with lateral p-i-n diodes will yield electrically triggered single photon emitters. By using the QD to provide a strong optical nonlinearity, a single photon source (SPS) will be realized via the implementation of an on-chip photon blockade. Quantum interference in a photonic molecule increases the system’s sensitivity providing a practical path to the first integrated photon blockade device - i.e a “holy grail” of the Quantum photonics community - and provide opportunities for coherent protocols not possible with a single quantum dot.', 'single-photon source, quantum dot, sige, nonlinear optics, quantum communication, quantum dot laser, cmos compatible source');

An indication of achieving the project goal is number of project results specified in section 2.6.1. (main results). A monolithic detector, compared to hybrid detectors which are widely used, is composed of only a single chip, which contains both the sensor part and front-end electronic part while in the case of a hybrid detector the sensor and electronics are integrated in separate chips and interconnected by relatively expensive technology. The monolithic solution allows fabrication of very compact detector of radiation with low electric power consumption. The effective way of fabrication of the monolithic sensors represents a significant potential for commercial usage. The project will be worked out by cooperation of research group at FNSPE-CTU and UJP PRAHA a.s. The monolithic pixel sensor will be iteratively developed in the first two phases of the project. In the final (third) phase, the sensor will be implemented in a compact radiation detector. A distinctive feature of the developed sensor is dose measurement based on counting of individual particles in a compact microelectronic chip.

Mechanical properties of the alloy are close to those of bone tissue and implants from such alloy can therefore provide sufficient support to the healing tissue without undesirable stress shielding effect. Implants from such alloy also exhibit osteoinductive properties and its degradation promotes bone tissue healing process.  The implant is gradually resorbed by organism during healing process providing support. After the healing process ends, no metal residues are left in the body and there is no need for costly operation for implant removal. Application of biodegradable implants is therefore less invasive, comparing to commonly used bioinert materials.  For cell adhesion to the implant, not only implant material type or its surface treatment is important, but also state of the implant surface. Therefore, bulk and porous implants as well as implants with bulk core and porous surface layer will be tested. For the production of implants, selective laser melting method will be used.

The goal of this project is to design and manufacture Mg alloys with optimized microstructure to enhance corrosion resistance, biological response and mechanical properties. Achieving this aim requires interdisciplinary approach, which is ensured by high degree of complementarity of cooperating research teams. Mg alloys containing Nd, Zn, Zr and Y will be thermo-mechanically processed by various techniques. Microstructural characterization will be correlated to corrosion properties and in-vitro biological tests.

Anticoagulant treatment with warfarin can lead to adverse bleeding events, some of which can be life threatening. Recently, two new options for thrombus prevention have been developed. The first is the novel anticoagulants (NOAC), which were associated with slightly better safety profiles due to a lower frequency of intracranial bleeding in large randomized trials .

Scattered, excessively small parcels cease to be economically viable for individual farming, and owners feel forced to rent these parcels to larger subjects farming on adjacent land. Our last study demonstrates a phenomenon that we call the Farmland Rental Paradox, where very small parcels (< 1.07 ha) tend to create large production blocks by being rented to larger farmers, and therefore to significantly homogenize the land-use pattern. Below this threshold, the smaller the parcels are, the larger the blocks that they tend to create. This project analyses the speed of the fragmentation process in the Czech Republic. It goes on to assess methods of defragmentation, and economic impacts of the dominance of the land rental market. The serious negative impacts of extreme land-ownership fragmentation show that this phenomenon can be considered as a significant cause of economic land degradation.', 'agriculture land, land ownership, socioeconomics indicators, sustainable land use, fragmentation');

However, few robotic components are designed for easy adaptation and reuse. To overcome those shortcomings, R5-COP focuses on agile manufacturing paradigms and specifically on modular robotic systems. Based on existing and newly developed methods for a formal modeling of hardware and software components, R5-COP will support model-based design, engineering, validation, and fast commissioning.

Arginine repressor (ArgR) is the master regulator of the arginine regulon in a wide variety of bacteria and provides feedback control over biosynthesis and catabolism of L-arg. Asymmetric allosteric activation of ArgR is an apparent paradox in view of the role of symmetry anticipated by the MWC model. Negative cooperativity was not anticipated by the model, but it might be physiologically useful because such different affinities create two action levels in the protein''s response to L-arg. Interpretation of this complex system requires an understanding of the protein''s conformational landscape.

The strategy aims at improvements based on degradation studies and materials development carried out in previous and ongoing projects (FCH JU DEMMEA 245156) so that they will lead to a reliable cost-effective product that fulfils all prerequisites for relevant field uses. These improvements cope with degradation issues related to catalyst utilization, reformate feed contaminants, uniform diffusivity and distribution of reactinggases in the catalytic layer, pinhole development due to local high current density spots, H3PO4 acid depletion and distribution within the MEA, startup-stop and thermal cycles. The ultimate aim of DeMStack is to deliver HT PEMFC components for operationtemperatures at 180oC and up to 200oC. Mainly optimized long lasting polymer electrolytes, stable Pt based electrocatalysts with minimal Pt loads and effective architectures of flow fields on bipolar plates will be explored. DeMStack will design, manufacture and test under variable conditions a highly efficient, low-cost HT PEMFC 1 kW stack prototype constructed from the optimized components. A fuel processor will also be constructed, operating on natural gas or LPG, which will be combined and integrated with the fuel cell stack.', 'ht pemfc, scaling up, polymer electrolyte, pt based electrocatalysts, degradation mechanisms, stack manufacturing, bipolar plates, mathematical modelling, engineering impimization, fuel processor');

The presence or absence of water significantly affects the distribution of power between the two main streams of heat: the latent heat of evaporation and sensible heat. Once the water is not present in the landscape sufficiently, a large part of the solar energy is converted to sensible heat and the ambient temperature increases substantially. Destruction of the hydrological cycle man, mainly drainage landscape, disrupting carbon storage in soil and vegetation, and reduces water retention capacity of the landscape. Reducing the water content of the soil leads to an increase in oxidation processes and loss of organic matter from the soil.

The Czech Republic is also devoted to the study of wetlands attention, but a general awareness of the importance of this ecosystem is still not at the desired level in comparison with the U.S.. For this reason it is necessary to devote to the study of wetlands and disseminate knowledge not only among the professional public, but also among civil servants at all levels. Recently wetlands become the focus of interest due to their ability to store carbon and nutrients. These facts were known previously, but the pressure of agriculture, industry and urbanization meant thatuntil recently were systematically drained wetlands.

The submitted project is focussed on resolving this issue. A reduction in material and energy intensity will be achieved by increasing the utility value of products using new advanced technologies. The project aims to improve technology for the creation of high hydro-/ oleo- phobic surfaces, which will be subsequently used in contact with liquids. These layers will be prepared based on plasma technology and nanotechnology in various materials and products. Hydrophobia or oleophobia causes the liquid to run down the surface, meaning that the liquid flowing on the surface does not stick. This greatly reduces shear stress and hydraulic losses. Also, the surfacetreatment prevents precipitates depositing on the surface of a material wetted by a liquid, or if they are excreted then they only have a low adhesion to the surface. Treatment of a hydraulic surface using a hydro-/ oleo- phobic film will have a major significance in terms of energy savings, since it is assumed that about 25% of the total energy produced is consumed for pumping liquids. The surface treatment of tailing ponds etc. will reduce the formation of deposits. Another part of the project addresses the utilization of the specific phenomenon occurring between the highly phobic surface and the liquid, where a continuous layer of gas is created.

Degree of tolerance to heat and cold-shock has a direct impact on plant fitness, and, consequently, plant productivity. Still, temperature perception remains poorly understood. Global transcriptome analysis revealed transcripts differentially regulated in response to temperature stress, including those involved in plant hormone cytokinin (CK) signaling. To get a deeper insight into functional relevance of the previous transcriptomic data, we propose to identify the fraction of plant proteome and phosphoproteome that undergoes differential regulation under heat- and cold-stress in Arabidopsis. CKs have been implicated in increased tolerance to heat-shock, and cross-talk between temperature and CK signaling has been hypothesized. We next propose to analyze in detail mutual modulation of temperature and CK signaling, and, thereby, to get novel knowledge on cross-talk between these two signals on proteomic level and its projection to growth regulation.', 'temperature perception cytokinins arabidopsis thaliana proteome phosphoproteome 2-d electrophoresis mass spectrometry');

To prevent this, cells evolved a highly conserved DNA damage response pathway (DDR) that senses DNA damage and stops the cell cycle progression to allow DNA repair. There is now emerging evidence that oncogene-induced senescence acts as a tumorigenesis barrier. Inactivating mutations in genes of DDR pathway (such as p53) predispose to cancer. Another possibility how cells can overcome tumorigenic barrier is premature termination of the checkpoint. PP2C family phosphatase Wip1 is responsible for silencing of the DDR through dephosphorylation of multiple substrates. Locus of Wip1 is amplified in human cancers and Wip1 is an attractive target for cancer treatment. Here we propose to study a role of Wip1 and other components of the DDR in oncogenesis and in senescence. By solving the structure of Wip1 we expect to facilitate structure based drug design and development of novel inhibitors specifically targeting Wip1.

Two kinds of mechanisms, cap-dependent scanning and internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-driven mechanism, were proposed to regulate the initiation of translation. Translation initiation at IRES was first identified in picornaviruses, but a number of cellular mRNAs containing IRESs have subsequently been discovered. Interestingly, vast number of the IRES bearing genes is involved in cell proliferation, cellular transformation and regulation of apoptosis. IRES-driven translation may help them to escape many control mechanisms that regulate cap-dependent translation, and provide the cell with a high degree of spatial and temporal control that is needed to response to upstream stress signals.
